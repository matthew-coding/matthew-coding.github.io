            <p>
                Hi everyone, my names Matthew and welcome to this eyesore I call my blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                Im coming into Dev Academy with essentially 0 experience in the web development field, and so far its
                been a blast, even during the times where I wanted to pull all my hair out and throw the computer out
                the window. But despite it all its been an enjoyable experience so far, and I hope to see you all at the
                bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to learn coding to pick up a new skill and fingers crossed, a new career. My work experience so
                far in my life has been several years of retail and double that in security. To be frank, I needed a
                change, and Dev Academy seemed like a great place to start a journey into a new field for me that so far
                I've been really enjoying.
            </p>
