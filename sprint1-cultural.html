              <h3>Taking the next step</h3>
              <p>
                In January of 2020 I left my job of two and half years at Shosha in order to study in a field which was completely foreign to me. I knew I was unhappy with my current lot in life, I was stuck in a dead end job where I had no prospects of career advancement and didn’t agree with on a professional and moral level, I had a multitude of bills to pay as me and my brother inherited our house from our parents, and I felt like my personal life was coming to a stop. Everyone around me was starting to advance in their own fields and careers and I wanted to be able to join them in that endeavor and be a complete, fulfilled person. 
              </p>
              <p>
                While I knew resigning from this job was the best thing to do, I had a lot of doubts in my mind of whether to do it. The primary reason was finance, while I wasn't making much, I made enough to contribute to my household and to pay for my own personal expenses, and for a long time that was enough for me. Thankfully I had family and friends close to me who all echoed the same sentiment, they all believed I was capable of doing more with my life than working in a retail position, and when I had found something I was interested in doing with Dev Academy, they supported me wholeheartedly, which in no small part really convinced me to take this prospect a lot more seriously. While I could let myself down, I would never want to let them down.

                I don’t know if I am particularly influenced by my ethnical culture (half Niuean), but I feel as though my influences growing up, my mother, my friends, the country of New Zealand itself have imprinted on me my own version of community or whanau. They helped me realize the importance of laughter, of togetherness and of being there for other people when they need it, and having the bond to have people return that favour in kind.

              <h3>My Strengths and Limitations</h3>
              <p>
                I like to think whenever I go into a project I can keep the big picture in mind, the overarching goal if you will. However this does mean at times I do have a tendency to gloss over the minutiae. Through my current first week of Dev Academy in several of the challenges set for us I have read the first set of instructions, assumed what was expected based on the summary and blazed forward in my work only to realize I had skipped over several steps in the process. Most of the time this didn’t negatively affect my work, but it is a habit I need to work on.  
              </p>
              <p>
                I find I can do very good work when I am motivated in what I am doing. When I studied at the University of Auckland I got exceptional grades on topics I loved, such as evolutionary biology and ecological systems, but in topics I wasn’t so passionate about (Anything to do with plants, I find plants somewhat boring), I struggled to stay motivated, even though they were and important and large part of my studies.  
              </p>
              <p>
                If I could combine these two properties though it would be a great boon for any study I do, being able to keep the big picture in mind to help me through the less interesting parts, and realize the connections between the topics I look at. For instance in biology, I love almost anything to do with animal life, but I struggle to stay interested in anything plant based, however the two are connected. Plants rely on animals, and animals rely on plants, you can't separate the two. I hope to try apply the same thought to any struggles I find on this journey, and trust that whatever content presented to me all connects back to everything else, and that by taking in all of this information I will at the end have a more complete understanding and proficiency in web development.

                In my degree several years ago I did have a few opportunities to work collaboratively with others on assignments. One such example was a group project we needed to do in Shakespear national park where we were looking at the effects of detritus on plant growth, and whether more plants were growing closer to the remains of dead ones.  
              </p>
              <p>We actually eventually agreed on this topic as none of us could agree on which specific topic we wanted to do on our field research. I wanted to do a field study on the New Zealand Falcon, but we eventually reached a conclusion that it simply wouldn’t be feasible based on the amount of time we had to do work in the field, and based on the knowledge that the course had given us to that point. I remember several of my peers in my group also wanted to do our group project on specific animals they were interested in, but as a group we settled on plants after a discussion on what was actually possible for us to do effectively that would definitely give us accurate findings to base our paper off of.  </p>
              <p>I think compromising there was a good idea and we handled it well, while none of us really got to do the specific topic we wanted, we managed to find a subject that was within our means to do, had readily available sources to research and would produce statistically significant results worthy of writing a paper about. </p>
