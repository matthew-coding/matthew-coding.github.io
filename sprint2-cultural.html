                If I had to be realistic, being a front end web developer seems like a pretty cool job, it’s a field im
                exceptionally new to as you can see from the quality of my blog, but it's been pretty fulfilling so far
                just being able to make something like this. If I'm allowed to dream I would absolutely love to get into
                something like game development, it's one of those passions I've had for such a long time that I always
                have the thought in the back of my mind of just dropping everything to go learn about it.
            </p>



            <p>
                I would love to learn effective time management, it's one of those skills I've lacked a lot throughout my
                life, and the somewhat self-directed study of the foundations course is really pushing me in that area.
                Good communication is another one, I have been described as an introverted grumpy cat by my flat mate
                and she probably isn't wrong.
            </p>



            <p>
                I think I'm very good at working on things that I'm passionate about, which is a strength and a weakness,
                and I'm pretty good at co-operating with others, although in a group work setting I do tend to follow
                others rather than submitting my own ideas. Time management as I've talked about is another area I'm
                weak in and I do get easily distracted.
            </p>



            <p>
                I've thought about it for a while and while I'm studying at home at least I'm just trying to limit
                possible distractions, when I'm working I'll turn off my social media, close any apps that could present
                a distraction via pop up notifications or anything like that. 
            </p>



            <p>
                I've already given up doing several things that I knew wouldn’t be compatible while I'm studying at Dev
                Academy, I've changed or temporarily stopped several social obligations, and have ceased working during
                the study period, and I will commit to communication with my cohorts and facilitators, and always
                treating them with the respect they deserve.
            </p>



            <p>
                I expect the facilitation team will be there to help talk me through any problems I might be facing with
                the course, and maybe a little bit of encouragement, so far they’ve been doing a pretty stellar job.
            </p>



            <p>
                I don’t have really many block out times that I can think of, the only two things outside of Dev Academy
                I seriously need to commit time to are exercising, which I can be flexible with (thank you 24 hour
                gyms), and any social obligations I have to my friends, which take place outside of course hours anyway,
                and Ive made clear that my studies come first in this regard.
