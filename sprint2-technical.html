<p>Everything in an HTML page is essentially shaped like a box. Whenever you add a new piece of content into your webpage, it will be added as a box. 
Lets say you add a picture, and then add a separate line that adds a description about that picture. The two items you have added will both be in their own box.
When we understand this we can easily look at a webpage and divide it into its individual components, or individual boxes if you will. But without CSS the boxes will just arrange
themselves stacked atop one another. This is where altering the Margins, Borders and Padding of your boxes, or HTML elements becomes important, as it allows us to effectively 
move around and style things.</p> 

<p>The border is exactly that, a border around a specific piece of content. You can choose to make this border visible, or not, depending on what you are doing, but the content inside
will not extend past the border of the box.</p>

<p>Next is your padding, padding is the space between the content within your border and the border itself.</p>

<p>Margins are the spaces between your boxes. With no margin the borders of your content will sit directly next to eachother touching. With margins you can space individual pieces of 
content of your page apart from eachother. </p>
