            <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to manage and identify one's own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.</p> 

 

<p>It is commonly said to be made up of three components, or three core skills. Emotional Awareness, the ability to harness those emotions and apply them in thinking or other tasks, and the ability to manage those emotions, yours and those of people around you.</p> 

 

<p>It is commonly referred to as EQ, or your Emotional Quotient, similar to your IQ. However unlike IQ there is no exact measurement, or valid psychiatric test you can make of a person's EQ. Because of this it has been argued that Emotional Intelligence isn't a true construct like IQ, but is more a catch all term for multiple personal and interpersonal skills that make it up.</p> 

 

<p>In recent years Emotional Intelligence has become a huge factor for many people seeking employment, studies have shown that employees in high ranking position often have a higher emotional intelligence as it is theorized that a higher EQ can make someone a more productive worker, or a better leader in a management position. While these studies have only shown a correlation as of now, since there is no definite way of measuring a person's EQ, many employers have implemented Emotional Intelligence tests into their hiring and application processes, making it an important set of skills to possess.</p> 

 

<p>Outside of the workplace though, it's still an important skill set to have, being able to identify and manage your emotions can help you in everyday life, like when you're stuck in traffic, or just having a bad day. And being able to recognize the emotions of people around you and respond to them appropriately can help immensely in interpersonal relationships you have with anyone.</p>
