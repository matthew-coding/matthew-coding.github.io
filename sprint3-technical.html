            <h3>HTML and CSS</h3> 

 

            <p>In making webpage HTML and CSS are two very important components, HTML deals with the structure and content of your page, the amount of paragraphs, the content within them, links to other websites, any pictures you might add or other items. CSS provides the style, it chooses the colour of your text, your background colours, where your elements are located, their size, any borders they might have and other things.</p> 
            
             
            
            <p>It's like a house a house needs foundations, walls, a ceiling etc. HTML is like a builder, it puts all of those items there that are necessary for the house to exist. CSS then would be like an interior decorator, it adds things like what carpet you have, the colour or pattern of your wallpaper, anything that styles the already existing structure.</p> 

            <h3>Control Flow</h3> 

 

            <p>Depending on what information is supplied to our browser, we want it to act differently, we can use several statements to control how our code runs such as if, if/else, for loops, while loops and do while loops.</p> 
            
             
            
            <p>A loop is basically a line of code that runs over and over until it is told to stop or a condition has been meet. In the most common loops there are three things that are vital for it to run.</p> 
            
             
            
            <ul> 
            
            <li>The initialization : This is a piece of code that sets our starting point.</li> 
            
            <li>The condition: This piece of code tells us when our loop can stop.</li> 
            
            <li>And the final expression: This is a line of code that will run every time a single cycle of our loop completes.</li> 
            
            </ul> 
            
             
            
            <p>As an example let's pretend that the late great Billy Mays is going door knocking to sell bottles of OxiClean™ for $10 dollars each. At the start of the day Billy has $0, and he needs to make $100 before he can finish for the day. Because this is Billy, no one can refuse a pitch from him so he will always make a sale when he knocks on a door, and because he's selling quality product, a given household only needs to buy one bottle of OxiClean™. Billy really needs to go home because Game of Thrones is on tonight, and its 2013 so it hasn’t gotten bad yet.</p> 
            
             
            
            <p>So we have Billy's Initializer, he has $0. We have his condition, make $100, and we have his final expression, he makes $10 after every sale cycle. After every sale cycle Billy checks his wallet to see whether he has met his condition of making $100 dollars. If he hasn’t he has to do another cycle of the loop, if he has, he has achieved his condition and can finally go home and watch Game of Thrones.</p> 

            <h3>The DOM</h3> 

 

            <p>So your webpage is made up of HTML, CSS and Javascript, but theres one more thing to mention. The Document Object Model, or the DOM for short. It's like a glue that holds all these three things together in a webpage. All your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files all go into this object that is the DOM, a representation of your building blocks that is shown in your web browser.</p> 
            
             
            
            <p>Using the DOM we can actually use Javascript to change the content of our HTML document without changing the HTML document itself, going back to the house analogy it's like if you could flip a switch on your wall and add a whole new room to your house without having to hire the guy who built the place again. </p> 

            <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3> 

 

            <p>Arrays are essentially lists arranged within square brackets, think like a shopping list you'd have things like [milk, eggs, bread, cereal, coffee]. Your array will have a name and you can access data from it using the name and a set of brackets with the number of the item within it. Remember that arrays start their counting from 0, so if you wanted to access the first item in your shopping list you would need to do shoppingList[0] in order to get milk.</p> 
            
             <!--Add Image-->
            
            <p>Objects are pretty similar, however instead of having a straight list of values, the items inside it come in pairs, a key and a value. Think like your shopping list but this time you've added how many of each item you need.</p> 

            <p>So using the object I can use the object name, and a key to find out the value of this key. I want to know how many bottles of milk I need to buy, then I can just run shoppingList.milk() and I will get back that I need to buy 2 bottles of milk, as opposed to an array which would just tell me that I need to buy milk.</p> 

            <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3> 

 

<p>A function in Javascript is essentially a wrapper for code, they allow us to save a lot of time. Let's go back to Billy Mays on his sales route, Billy needs to tell his boss how much money he made each day selling bottles of OxiClean™. He has the price of an individual bottle, and the amount he sold each day, but on some days he does special deals where for that day only, a customer can get a bottle of OxiClean for the low low price of only $6. 

 

In Javascript Billy could do something like this for each day</p> 

<!--Add image-->

<p>Takes up a lot of space doesn’t it? Instead Billy could use a function that does the calculation for him</p> 

 

<!--Add Image-->
 

<p>Now Billy only has to use a single line of code to find out sales for the day, and he can keep using this function as long as it's in his page.</p>

<p>A lot tidier isnt it?</p>
