        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the idea that the brain is not a static object, it is a plastic one, capable of growth and
            change.
            Neural pathways in our brain are what allow us to accomplish the tasks we set out to do, and there are countless
            amounts
            of them, a pathway for walking, a pathway for typing, a pathway for talking, everything we do.
        </p>

        <p>
            For a long time it has been stated that when an individual reaches adulthood that their brain becomes fixed, and
            that
            potential for learning diminishes dramatically, see the age old saying "You can't teach an old dog new tricks".
            But in
            the last several decades more and more research has been going into the concept of Neuroplasticity, and how it
            can be
            used not just for learning, but in fields like medicine, helping people recover from debilitating physical
            injuries, or
            in psychology and helping people recover from trauma, or even things like stress, anxiety or depression.
        </p>
        <p>
            By practicing an activity we start to form Neural pathways for it, we strengthen the existing pathways, and
            depending on
            how we practice we can even link those pathways together.
        </p>

        <p>
            Neuroplasticity can be increased in a variety of ways, from travelling, learning an instrument, reading fiction,
            or even
            sleeping. All of these activities encourage growth or connection between neurons in your brain, strengthening
            our
            neuroplasticity!

        <h1>The Growth Mindset</h1>
        <p>
        
            The Growth mindset goes hand in hand with the concept of Neuroplasticity. At its core the Growth Mindset is about
            how our attitude towards things we want to achieve can impact our success. Moved from a fixed mindset about
            intelligence and what is possible to a growth mindset, understanding that intelligence is an attribute that can be
            changed in many studies has shown a significant increase in performance and results.
        
        </p>

            Research by Carol Dweck in an elementary school in America on the Growth Mindset showed some very interesting
            results about the role of teachers in contributing to a growth mindset. The type of encouragement given to students
            actually affected their ability to solve given problems. Students who were praised simply for being smart actually
            ended up being able to solve less problems on average than students who were praised for their hard work and the
            effort they put in. Encouraging effort rather than innate ability was key in fostering a growth mindset in students,
            and paid off when looking at the results.

            Currently in my learning journey I'm still trying to change from having a fixed mindset to having a growth mindset.
            Ingrained habits are difficult to break, but through getting help from other people, and being able to succeed in
            challenges presented to me I initially thought were impossible have really helped me push into belief that I can do
            these things, that I can adapt and learn.
