        I was doing the JavaScript Olympics Repl.it exercise earlier today and I got totally stumped on the very last task
        it asked of me, to make a function that takes an assortment of values, an athletes name, the sport they play, their
        age, and a quote of theirs, and save it as an object so it could be referenced later.
    
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>
    
        I tried a lot of things and nothing seemed to work, I was doing all these for loops trying to cycle through every
        value, I used pseudocode to work out what steps I should take, I talked my poor dogs ear off going over what I was
        doing, nothing worked. I actually decided to try look at the sample solution they gave us. I usually try not to do
        this, but in this case I was clearly missing something, and I wanted to be able to work backwards, look at how to
        solve it, and correctly identify why this code worked but mine didn't.
    
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>
    
        It turned out the solution was exceptionally simple, all I had to do essentially was build an object and put the
        names of the values into it. I felt like a huge idiot, but I think I learned that bigger isn't always better. Just
        because I have a hammer doesn't mean every problem I come across needs to look like a nail. It was a good experience
        to have I think, just being able to see that sometimes what I need to do can be as simple as it seems
    
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>
    
        Now when I solved a problem in an elegant way, is a bit harder to talk about since most of my methods I tend to use
        are quite brutish. I am quite proud of my solution to the FizzBuzz Repl.it challenge, often for a lot of these
        coding challenges I struggle quite a lot, and this one honestly was no exception.
    
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>
    
        However this one sticks out for me because I successfully managed to use the pseudocode problem solving method
        effectively. I wrote down the steps I needed to take and successfully executed them after a bit of thought on how to
        tackle it. I even figured out the proper ordering of my commands after a bit of trial and error interpreting the
        error messages that popped up.
    
        It definitely taught me a few things about JavaScript, particularly in how JavaScript reads what you've written and
        in what order it does things.
    
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>
    
        I think out of the problem solving techniques we were introduced to in this sprint, the ones I'm most comfortable
        with using are
    
    </p>
    
    
    
    <ul>
    
        <li>Pseudocode</li>
    
        <li>Trying Stuff</li>
    
        <li>Reading Error Messages</li>
    
        <li>Googling</li>
    
        <li>Asking Coaches for help</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <p>
    
        Pseudocode is just an absolute life saver, its super helpful to be able to just write down what I think I need to
        do. While sometimes the thing I think I need to do turns out to be wrong, it does give me a good starting point for
        coding.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Trying stuff is where I feel the most comfortable, I think I'm a very "hands on" type of learner, I absorb knowledge
        a lot faster when I can just try something, whether I succeed or fail.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Reading error messages has become something I've gotten quite accustomed to, and the initial sting of failure
        whenever the dreaded red text pops up has subsided quite a lot to the point where I see it as more of a helpful
        suggestion on JavaScripts part.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Googling problems occurs quite often for me, and the skill has gotten a bit easier since I've gotten more familiar
        with terms that JavaScript uses.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When all else fails as well I do know a good amount of people who know what they're doing in regards to coding and
        are always happy to give me a hand when I'm struggling with an issue. I do my best to not get an answer to the
        challenge im doing, but rather input on my method, or an explanation of why what I tried doesn’t work.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As for the other problem solving techniques presented to us, I think the rubber ducky method is still a work in
        progress for me. I don’t really have an inanimate object around that I feel comfortable talking to, so usually I
        just use my flatmates dog who is often napping on the couch nearby. He is a fantastic listener, and I think its
        still good to try to organize my thoughts a lot more
