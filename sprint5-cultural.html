            <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
            </h4>



            <p>
                I think a big assumption I had about myself going into this course was that I was a relatively quick
                learner, and that I could adapt fast. While I have I think adapted to a good degree, the core curriculum
                has
                kind of made me see that mindset isn't a good one, nor a sustainable one. It made running into blocks
                early
                on quite difficult to get over, but with the context of neuroplasticity and the growth mindset its
                helped me
                try leave that behind.
            </p>
            <p>I think some of the mindfulness exercises put into perspective that even though I like to consider myself
                open to a lot of things, I can be dismissive of things I don’t think are necessary, such as the
                meditation
                stuff, I'm trying to work through that more.
            </p>



            <p>
                My emotional intelligence probably isnt necessarily where it needs to be, even though once again I do
                like
                to think Im a very empathetic person, it made me have to look at myself and realize that I struggle
                dealing
                with my own emotional reaction to things.
            </p>







            <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>


            <p>
                These three attributes are important basically everywhere, they help you make the right choices in life,
                and
                in these two aspects, learning and programming, they're no different. Your values can affect your
                attitude
                when it comes to learning, and having empathy allows you respect other peoples values, even if they
                differ
                from your own. Self Awareness is a necessary skill in both of these fields as you need to know yourself,
                you
                need to know how you learn, what facilitates a good learning environment, and when a method you're
                trying
                just wont work and its time to try something else.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a team environment like programming often is these three attributes are also incredibly important,
                having
                empathy and self awareness can inform you when you may be affecting others around you, and what you can
                do
                to change that to foster a better working environment
            </p>




            <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>


            <p>
                How much I had to learn about myself really, it’s a very personal thing, and I think just as surprising
                as
                that was how necessary it actually is to be able to actualize yourself
            </p>


            <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>


            <p>
                The self reflection, I think correctly and honestly evaluating yourself, your beliefs, your work method
                etc
                are some of the hardest things you can actually do
            </p>


            <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development bootcamp course?</h4>


            <p>
                Human skills are the most important aspect of any job you can have, and its important that your personal
                skills are just as good if not better than your technical skills. Web Development and programming in
                general
                is a field in which interacting with other people, clients and co-workers, is a guarantee, and you need
                to
                be able to co-operate with them to find success.
            </p>


            <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
                that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>


            <p>
                Initially yes I did think it was a waste of time, and to be honest I am still somewhat apprehensive
                about
                it. After all it’s a lot easier to measure progress on a technical level than on a personal level.
            </p>

            <p>
                But I think its important, having gone through tertiary education before, while I gained necessary
                skills
                for those career paths, no schooling institute really made an effort to equip me for the wider world
                with
                skills that weren't just technical or knowledge based.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>

            <p>
                No destination in mind specifically as of now, but I would like to enter the tech industry and make a
                career
                out of it. Ideally I'd make a huge impact and become the next Bill Gates, so as long as I aim for that
                either I'll get there or at least somewhere close
            </p>




            <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>


            <p>
                Probably just the workload and dealing with that will be my biggest hurdle, and the 8:30am starts will
                be
                rough too, its been a while since I've had to consistently be awake early. But I'll be able to deal with
                it.
                I think a good strength of mine is I generally get along with people pretty well, so im sure in a
                "small"
                cohort itll be a good asset to have
            </p>




            <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>


            <p>
                Speaking in front of large groups does scare me somewhat, but I think focusing for 9 weeks on such an
                intensive course will probably be my biggest challenge. I think to stay on top of that I just need to
                keep
                my goals in mind, clearing this course, getting into the industry, and being able to ration my personal
                time
                so that I can destress and stay on top of things
            </p>




            <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
            </h4>

            <p>
                I'd love to see my communication skills develop a lot, being able to convey ideas I have in a concise
                and
                clear manner, whenever I try to speak about a lot of things I do tend to ramble or lose my point.
            </p>

            <p>
                Confidence too would be a good plus, just being confident in myself, my abilities, and the things I set
                out
                to do
            </p>




            <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>

            <p>
                My expectations of myself at Bootcamp will definitely be to stay focused on my tasks, and to not let
                myself
                or anyone relying on me down, whether that be my friends, my family, my facilitators or my team members
                in
                any group projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                I know that I'm not a tech wiz, and I am still very green to the whole business, so I expect to not beat
                myself up over mistakes, that Im not going to get everything right on the first, second, third or even
                tenth
                time, but that I will take away lessons from my experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                A journal entry would be very helpful here, and im going to commit to have a journal that I update
                regularly
                with my experiences, what im struggling with, and where I need to improve. If working on these issues
                that I
                find in myself by myself isnt working, I will seek help from others to help push me in the right
                direction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course I cant always be the one asking for help, so I will also endeavor to help others in my cohort,
                if
                there is a technical problem that I can help with I will do my best, and Ill make sure to support them
                in
                their ventures or challenges, and always treat them with respect, in order to foster a healthy working
                environment where people can feel comfortable to be in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ill seek help on a technical side from members of my cohort, from the facilitators and teachers, or from
                any
                coaches that I have. And on a personal side Ill be sure to check in with the human skills facilitator if
                im
                getting overwhelmed and need to talk or have some guidance
